        <h1>Weekend Oatmeal</h1>
        <img src="../images/oats.jpeg" alt="Oatmeal with bananas and blueberries">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>During the work week, I prioritize every second of sleep in the morning. For me, that means soup for breakfast - it takes almost no time to dump half a can in a bowl and microwave it, but it's not the most filling. On the weekend, I have time to make myself something more substantial. I can't really stomach oatmeal on its own, but with some doctoring it goes from lumpy and slimy to smooth, creamy, and satisfying</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2C rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2C milk of your choice</li>
            <li>1/2C water</li>
            <li>Smooth, <strong>natural</strong>, unsalted peanut or almond butter.</li>
            <li>Maple syrup</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Fruit of your choice - banana, strawberries, blueberries, and peach are my favorites, but you do you</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine oats, milk, and water in a bowl that can fit 3-4C of liquid</li>
            <li>Microwave on high for 1:30. Stop, stir, and microwave for another minute. This will keep things from boiling over.</li>
            <li>Immediately after removing the bowl from the microwave, grab a clean spoon and scoop up a hefty serving of your peanut or almond butter. Measure with your heart.</li>
            <li>Stir the peanut or almond butter into the hot oatmeal, mashing against the sides of the bowl if it's not incorporating.</li>
            <li>Drizzle some maple syrup on top, to your taste. Sprinkle some cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Add your fruit, stir, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
