        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My family are all big tea drinkers, but usually we don't have the time to make true spiced chai. We settle for a tea bag, some milk, and maybe some sugar if we're feeling indulgent. But every once in a while, we crave the real thing, or at least something close to it. This is the recipe I use, from @crossculturekev on tiktok, but feel free to make it your own!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tsp loose leaf black tea - Assam is best</li>
            <li>1C water</li>
            <li>1C milk of your choice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp crushed ginger or ginger paste</li>
            <li>2 cardamom pods</li>
            <li>1/2 inch cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 clove - optional</li>
            <li>your choice of sweetener</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush fresh ginger if using, cardamom, cinnamon, peppercorns, and clove. If using ginger paste, add to other ingredients once crushed. </li>
            <li>Add water to a pot that can hold at least 4 cups. Heat over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the water is simmering, add the tea and the crushed spices from step 1.</li>
            <li>When the water comes to a rolling boil, add the milk.</li>
            <li>Stir once, then let simmer with the lid open until it reaches a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to low and let simmer another 30-45 seconds. If you like, you can scoop ladlefuls and pour them back in to help enhance the color.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add your sweetener. If this is your first time making this recipe, add a more conservative amount at this point; you can always add more once you taste it.</li>
            <li>Filter into a measuring cup or something else with a spout</li>
            <li>Find another empty cup or bowl that can accommodate the chai, preferably also with a spout. Pour the chai back and forth between the two cups/bowls a few times to aerate the chai. You should see some foam forming.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
